# Creating a Bare Bones Cataloging Module

## Creating the HTML Page and a PHP Cataloging Page

The first step is to create the HTML page
This needs to mirror the data in the *books* table
Containes author, title, publisher, copyright date

Create a new directory for the module 
‘cd /var/www/html
sudo mkdir cataloging’

Look at [Dr. Burn’s Github] (https://cseanburns.net/WWW/systems-librarianship/16.8-basic-opac-admin.html#creating-the-html-page-and-a-php-cataloging-page) for information needed

The next thing needed is the PHP script
This can also be found on Dr. Burn’s Github page. 

## Security

Currently, the whole world has access to this page. 
Because of this, need to go and secure this webpage with password
Be careful when following instructions, need to change directory 
from ** NONE** to **ALL**

After this is complete, login to the page using new password. 

## Thoughts and Challenges

This week was easier than I thought it was going to be. 
I am finally getting the hang of some of the commands
and am able to follow along with ease. 
I did not have to look on Element too many times
but the people on there are so kind and helpful. 

It is all finally starting to make sense as to WHY we 
are learning this and creating these things.
