# Creating a Bare Bones OPAC
## Step One: Creating the HTML PAge and a PHP Search Page
First step in creating the bare bones OPAC is to create an HTML page that can be used for entering queries. 
This bit is not too tricky, just follow the steps written on Dr. Burn's page. 
Go to [Dr. Burn's Github Page] (https://cseanburns.net/WWW/systems-librarianship/12-learn-git-and-github.html)
Follow the instructions and input the code given by copying and pasting. 
**make sure to insert your own IP address in the code!**
## Step Two: 
Insert more records into the books table that was created on MSQL. 
To do that connect to the MySQL server 
'mysql -u opacuser -p'
DON'T FORGET YOUR PASSWORD THIS TIME
Insert books using the same code as last week: 
'insert into books
(author, title, publisher, copyright) values
('Emma Donoghue', 'Room', 'Little, Brown \& Company', '2010-08-06'),
('Zadie Smith', 'White Teeth', 'Hamish Hamilton', '2000-01-27');'
## Thoughts and Feelings
These week was not too bad. 
I actually had a lot of fun pulling up my wesite 
and seeing the OPAC I had created. 
Need to be better about
